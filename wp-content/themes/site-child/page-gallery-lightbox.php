 *              lightbox grid (vanilla JS, no library).
 *
 * This page's stored builder content is a SiteOrigin [gallery] shortcode that
 * listed the same photos a second time, so show_content is set to false and
 * the legacy card is no longer printed. The stored content itself is left
 * untouched in the database (nothing is lost in the editor).

 * Curated photo collections.
 *
 * Every entry points at an existing media-library attachment, and each caption
 * describes what is actually in that file — written from the image itself or
 * taken from the attachment's stored alt text. Similar photos are kept in the
 * same collection so related work reads together.
 *
 * Like the other revamp pages this is a hardcoded array today; moving it to
 * ACF fields / the site_project CPT would be a content migration and needs
 * sign-off before it happens.
