# Day 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

> **Production restoration is done and verified.** The site is running production
> content at `http://localhost:10003`. Day 1 is closed — proceed to Day 2.

> ⚠️ **HISTORICAL RECORD — environment values below are stale.**
> This document records the state on 2026-09-06 and is kept as evidence of the
> restoration. Since then: LocalWP is **no longer running**; the live site is the
> Docker stack at `http://localhost:2026`; `site-child` is now **v1.1.0 and
> ACTIVE** (not the v1.0.0 inactive scaffold described below); WordPress is **7.1**
> and PHP **8.2.23**. For current values see `Docs/README.md` and
> `.clinerules/environment-and-testing.md`. For what was actually built afterwards,
> see `Docs/REVAMP-STATUS.md`.

## Verification Evidence

### Restore log (`wp-content/updraft/log.77b18c64c98d.txt`)
- Database unpacked and restored: *"Finished: lines processed: 268 in 8.65 seconds"*
- URL warnings confirm DB URLs are `http://localhost:10003/` (local ✓)
- Entities restored: database → plugins → themes → uploads (2801 + 536 files) → others
- Final status: **"Restore successful!"**
- Pre-restore files moved aside to `updraft/plugins-old/`, `themes-old/`, `uploads-old/`

### Live HTTP checks (2026-09-06)
- `GET http://localhost:10003/` → **200 OK**, `<title>SITE - SITE Enterprise Promotion</title>`
- REST API serving production page: `wp/v2/pages/7149`
- `wp-login.php` → 200

### Database snapshot (extracted from fresh post-restore backup)
- 79 tables, `db_version` 61833
- `blogname` = **SITE Enterprise Promotion** (production name ✓)
- 23 active plugins, active theme = `the-landscaper` (see `Docs/day-01/PLUGIN-CONFIGURATION.md`)
- Production origin paths visible (`/home/gundihil/public_html/s/site/`)

### Filesystem
- `wp-content/uploads/` = 481MB, year folders 2015–2026, real project imagery
  (e.g. `PWDs-in-Machakos-county-in-a-business-skills-training-event.jpg`)
- 23 × `woocommerce-placeholder-*.png` present (production files — removal scheduled Day 5)

---

## Current Technical State

- **Site URL**: `http://localhost:10003` (LocalWP)
- **PHP 8.2.29 / MySQL 8.4.0 / WP DB 61833**
- **Debugging**: WP_DEBUG on, errors → `wp-content/debug.log`, display off
- **Theme**: The Landscaper 2.6.1 (active) + `site-child` v1.0.0 scaffold present (inactive, ready for Day 2)
- **Plugins**: 23 active (Elementor, SiteOrigin, WooCommerce, RevSlider, ACF Pro, etc.)

## Notes & Considerations

- The restored stack includes SiteOrigin Panels + Elementor + RevSlider + WooCommerce
  demo content — **expected**; replacement happens Days 2–5, nothing removed before
  its replacement exists.
- Keep `wp-content/updraft/` (original production backup + post-restore DB backup)
  until the revamp is complete and a final verified backup exists.
- `wp-config.php` is intentionally **not** in version control (gitignored) — the
  WP_DEBUG change is documented here instead.
- `plugins-old/`, `themes-old/`, `uploads-old/` in the updraft folder are the
  pre-restore (fresh-install) leftovers — safe to ignore for now.

## Next Steps → Day 2: Theme Architecture & Content Structure

1. Activate `site-child` (already scaffolded — verify asset dependencies)
2. Register custom post types: Projects, Stories, Resources, Partners
3. Register taxonomies: Programs (primary), Locations, Themes, Resource Types
4. Begin plugin cleanup per `Docs/day-01/PLUGIN-CONFIGURATION.md` dispositions
